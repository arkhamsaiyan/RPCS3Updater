# RPCS3Updater
C# Program to update to the latest version of RPCS3

Usage: 

1. Extract all files from the latest release inside your RPCS3 folder (RPCS3Updater.exe, SharpCompress.dll)
2. Double click RPCS3Updater.exe (if you don't care about watching the output) or open a command window in the same directory and execute.
3. Answer the questions and watch the output.
4. It's really that simple!

How it works: 

It safely spiders RPCS3's download website and extracts the latest download link. It then downloads the file, extracts it, replacing your current files. It does not delete save games or any artifacts that were there previously.
